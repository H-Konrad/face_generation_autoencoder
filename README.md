# Face Generation Autoencoder
**Training and evaluating convolutional autoencoders for face reconstruction and generation using the CelebA dataset.**

---

## Overview 
This project uses convolutional autoencoders for learning representations of human faces. The goal was to train unsupervised learning models so that the decoder could generate new faces using a latent vector. 
By using different model architectures and training methods this project demonstrates how autoencoders can be used to compress and reconstruct iumages as well as generate new images.
